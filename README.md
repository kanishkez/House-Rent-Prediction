A machine learning model built with PyTorch to predict house rent in India based on features such as size, location, furnishing status, and more.

Dataset
Sourced from Kaggle: [House Rent Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset)

Model
The model is a single-layer linear regression using PyTorch and trained with Mean Absolute Error (L1Loss). Features are standardized using `StandardScaler`, and categorical variables are one-hot encoded.
