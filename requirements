1. Install dependencies:
    pip install pandas torch scikit-learn

2. Place `House_Rent_Dataset.csv` in the same directory as `house.py`.

3. Train the model:
    python3 house.py

4. On completion, it saves the trained weights to `house_rent_model.pth`.

- All categorical columns are one-hot encoded, including `Area Locality`.
- Floor level is numerically encoded using a custom extractor.

Feel free to build an interface or prediction layer on top of this.
